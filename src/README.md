About
Spell with a Friend is an application that scrapes live data from NYTimes Games to allow users to play a multiplayer version of the Spelling Bee. Users can submit words, see other playersâ€™ words, chat with friends, and save game data to come back and play later. Games are inactivated at 3 am when the NYTimes Spelling Bee letters reset.

You can start spelling at spellwithafriend.com.

Tech Stack
Spell with a Friend is built using NextJS. The live data is fetched from the NYTimes using Puppeteer, and the live user updates and chat are built using Socket.io.

Spell with a Friend is deployed on an AWS EC2.
